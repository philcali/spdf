# SPDF

This simple utility wraps [iText][1] and [flying saucer][2] to quickly create
PDF's from the commandline.

## Installation

```
cs philcali/spdf
```

## Usage

```
sdpf -h [file|folder|url...] -i [-o out.pdf]
```

The `url` must be in the form of `*://*`. The specified output file must be in
the form of `*.pdf*`.

The utility was designed to play nice with other CL tools, so input and output
can be piped and redirected (in fact, it is encouraged to do so).

```
cat flyer.html | spdf > out.pdf

curl www.google.com | spdf > google.pdf

lmxml flyer.lmxml | spdf -o out.pdf
```

## Creating Multiple Pages

It's possible to create a multiple page document from a sequence of
interspersed files, folders, or URL's by adding them to the var args.
For example:

```
spdf http://google.com /home/philip/flyer.pdf > branding.pdf

spd /my/book > book.pdf
```

By using the `-i` flag, you can pipe input files, folders, or URL's from
other shell commands. This would be particularly useful if you wanted to control
the order of pages. For example:

```
find ./book | grep ".html$" | spdf cover.html -i > book.pdf
```

This would first load `cover.html`, then all of the html files in a directory
called `book` piped to `spdf`. When run with `-i`, spdf expects valid inputs to
be separated by some kind of whitespace.

## Known Issues

1. Currently, flying saucer will explode trying to paint a grid layout.
2. The CSS resolver in flying saucer will throw a IOException, if it is given
   an empty or `null`, `InputStream`.

## License

Because spdf uses iText for PDF conversion, this application must also be
licensed under [AGPL][3].
